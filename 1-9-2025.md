## Macro & Policy Drivers
- **Fed Rate Outlook**: San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly reiterated support for a **25 bps cut** this month; markets price increased cut odds.

## Cross-Asset Read-Through
- **Equities**: Weakness in SPY/NDQ reflects investor caution given upcoming data risks.  
- **Precious Metals**: Strength in gold & silver shows increased safe-haven demand amid dovish signals and policy uncertainty.  
- **Bonds**: Lower yields likely as rate-cut expectations rise — supporting metals and challenging equities.

## If / Then Outlook
- **If** Friday’s PCE/jobs prints are soft → yields likely fall further, supporting equities and metals.  
- **If** data surprises on the upside → yields could spike, weighing on equities and reducing precious-metals upside.

## What to Watch
- **U.S. PCE (September 1, release today)** — critical for Fed policy direction.  
- **U.S. Jobs report (Friday)** — key second data point in assessing rate-cut viability.

## Takeaway
Markets are shifting toward a **risk-off** mood after Monday’s selloff. Metals outperformed on rate-cut hopes and policy clarity, but **the Friday data duo** (PCE + jobs) will likely determine whether the recent dips reverse or deepen.
