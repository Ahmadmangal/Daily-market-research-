---

## Executive Summary (3 lines)
- Powell opened the door to a **September rate cut**, citing a “curious balance” in the labor market (both supply and demand weakening).  
- Tariff-driven inflation described as likely **transitory**, lowering structural inflation concern.  
- Market reaction: **2Y ≈ -10 bps, 10Y ≈ -7 bps**; equities rallied and the USD softened.

---

## Market Recap (short, numeric)
- **US 2Y:** down ~10 bps → ~3.69% (post-speech)  
- **US 10Y:** down ~7 bps → ~4.26% (post-speech)  
- **S&P 500:** rallied (broad gains)  
- **Gold:** modest rally as real-rates eased

---

## Key Highlights
- “**Curious balance**” in labor: Powell flagged downside risk to jobs (dovish tilt).  
- Tariff-driven inflation seen as temporary.  
- Subtle move away from strict FAIT language toward a **more preemptive, data-dependent** framework.

---

## Market Implications
- **Short end (2Y)** is most sensitive → watch for further compression if jobs/inflation weaken.  
- **Curve:** front-end may fall faster (flattening or complex moves depending on growth expectations).  
- **Risk assets:** equities/credit bid on cut odds; but inflation surprises would reverse moves.  
- **FX:** USD weaker on easing bets; EM/periphery may rally but watch any risk-off reversal.

---

## If / Then (trade-facing)
- **If** jobs soften & data confirm → front-end yields drop further; equities/gold rally.  
- **If** CPI/PCE surprise higher → cut odds fall and yields may bounce.  
- **If** Fed officials push back → quick volatility in yields/equities.

---

## What to Watch Next
- Monthly **NFP** / unemployment (confirm labor outlook)  
- **CPI** & **PCE** prints (inflation confirmation)  
- Intraday levels: 2Y ≈ 3.7% and 10Y ≈ 4.25% — breaks through these mark repricing

---

## Quick Takeaway
Powell’s speech opened the door to easing but it’s **conditional**: markets priced the talk immediately; now data must deliver.
