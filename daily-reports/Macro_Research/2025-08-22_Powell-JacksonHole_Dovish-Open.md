## Market Recap  
Market tone is cautious ahead of Powell’s closely watched Jackson Hole speech.  

U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are rising, reflecting uncertainty over impending rate policy.  

Indian markets slipped sharply, with Sensex down 500 points and Nifty falling below 25,000.  

## Focus: Powell’s Speech at Jackson Hole  
Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivers his final Jackson Hole address amid high expectations around rate-cut signals and macro-policy clarity.  

Markets are pricing in around a 75% probability of a September rate cut, though several Fed officials remain lukewarm.  

Key uncertainties include sticky core inflation, slowing job growth, and political pressure — especially from Trump.  

## Elements of Market Sensitivity  
- Gold slipped ~0.3% as a firm dollar and rate caution weighed on demand.  
- Forex & stocks remain volatile — investors watching Powell’s tone for clues on future policy direction.  

## Quick Insight  
Powell’s speech could either reaffirm hawkish caution or inch the Fed toward easing. Markets have already edged lower, preparing for either outcome — but any soft tone may reignite rate-cut bets, especially for September.  

## If/Then Scenarios  
- **If Powell sounds dovish (rate cuts sooner)** → 10Y yields likely drift toward 3.80%, gold strengthens, dollar softens.  
- **If Powell stays hawkish (no cut signals)** → yields stay elevated near 4.0%, equities could face more pressure, USD remains firm.
