## Market Overview

U.S. equities pulled back on Wednesday as risk sentiment cooled following recent gains. Investors showed renewed caution ahead of upcoming earnings releases and fresh economic data.

- **S&P 500 (SPX)** fell **–0.53%**  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** dropped **–1.00%**  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** declined **–0.70%**

The selloff was broad-based, led by weakness in technology and consumer discretionary sectors, as traders took profits after a strong start to the week.

## Commodities

Precious metals showed resilience despite the risk-off tone in equities.  
- **Gold** ticked higher after an early sharp but short-lived reversal from the **$4,300/oz** level.  
- **Silver** gained **+1.00%**, extending its rebound from last week’s declines.  

The uptick in metals came even as the dollar strengthened, indicating continued safe-haven interest.

## Currencies and Macro View

The **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)** rose **+0.18%**, maintaining a firm tone as investors favored the greenback amid global growth concerns.  

Overall, markets reflected a mild risk-off rotation — equities retreated, metals steadied, and the dollar strengthened — as traders awaited new catalysts from macro data and Fed commentary later this week.
