## Macro & Market Drivers

- Strong **bank earnings** had earlier boosted sentiment, especially for large institutions such as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, which reported robust results. 2  
- Renewed optimism in **AI / chip / tech** space was supported by stronger forecasts from TSMC and bullish spending narratives. 3  
- However, weak performance from regional banks (Zions, Western Alliance, etc.) due to loan defaults and legal issues triggered broader sector selling pressure. 4

## Bond, Dollar & Safe Havens

- Treasury yields fell strongly, with the **10-year yield** dropping to near **3.97%**, the lowest level since April. 5  
- The **U.S. dollar (DXY)** weakened nearly **–0.5%**, reflecting growing expectations of Fed easing and capital flows toward safer or yield-seeking assets. 6  
- **Gold** spiked higher, setting fresh records (with intraday and closing highs above previous levels), driven by safe-haven demand amid banking jitters and macro uncertainty. 7

- **Chip and AI names** tried to hold ground: Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD saw support amid TSMC’s upbeat outlook and continued AI sector flow. 10  
- **Tech / semiconductors** relatively outperformed defensive / financial sectors on the upside, though the gains were limited by overarching risk sentiment.

## Cross-Asset Take & Sentiment

The market’s risk dynamic shifted decisively toward **flight to quality**: equities took a hit, yields dropped, the dollar weakened, and gold soared.  
Investors appear to be pricing in deeper stress in the banking sector and increasing odds of Fed intervention (rate cuts) to stabilize markets.  
The AI / tech narrative is still a positive undercurrent, but it’s being overshadowed by credit concerns and earnings risk in financials.
