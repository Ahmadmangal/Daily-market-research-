# Daily Market Research — September 12, 2025  
*Uploaded Sep 13 PKT — researcher: Muhammad Ahmad*

## Market Recap
- **S&P 500** closed nearly flat (slight dip), **Nasdaq** rose ~0.45% to a fresh record, while **Dow Jones** dropped around 0.6%.  
  ([Reuters – Nasdaq record high close](https://www.reuters.com/business/nasdaq-notches-record-high-close-traders-look-fed-meeting-2025-09-12/), [AP-News wrap](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-equity-funds-record-biggest-weekly-outflow-five-weeks-2025-09-12/))

- Global equities inched higher overall, with MSCI indices showing gains, even as Treasury yields rebounded slightly after recent drops.

## Macro & Policy Drivers
- U.S. inflation data came in hotter than expected for core categories; headline CPI rose ~2.9% YoY in August. Meanwhile, job market softness continues. This mix keeps Fed rate cuts imminent but with risk of hesitation.

- University of Michigan's consumer sentiment fell for the second straight month to around 55.4, missing expectations. Inflation expectations over 5 years rose from 3.5% to 3.9%.

## Cross-Asset Insights
- **Gold** hit near-record highs, rallying on falling real yields and dollar concerns.

- **Oil** prices fell as oversupply and weaker U.S. demand outlook offset geopolitical tensions and supply risk.

- **U.S. dollar** slightly stronger in positioning moves but longer-term outlook remains weighed by expectations of rate cuts.  
  ([Reuters – dollar edges up but outlook negative](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-dollar-edges-up-positioning-moves-outlook-stays-negative-2025-09-12/))

## Sentiment & Flows
- U.S. equity funds recorded their largest weekly outflow in five weeks (~US$10.44B) as investors took profits amid valuation concerns. But tech/sectoral funds saw inflows.  
  ([Reuters – equity fund outflows](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-equity-funds-record-biggest-weekly-outflow-five-weeks-2025-09-12/))

- Sticky inflation plus rising 5-year inflation expectations are increasing the risk premium, but markets are valuing “Goldilocks” scenario: soft enough labor market + tolerable inflation = safe Fed cut.  

## If / Then Outlook
- **If** Fed meeting next week delivers dovish tone + cut = equities & gold likely to push higher, yields fall, dollar weakens.  
- **If** Fed warns inflation still too sticky or refuses to commit = risk of pullback in equities; safe assets outperform.

## What to Watch Next
- Fed meeting statements (especially Powell speech) for indication of rate path.  
- Core PCE inflation, services inflation, and jobless claims data.  
- Updates to trade & tariff policy that could affect commodity inflation.
