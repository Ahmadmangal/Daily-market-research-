### **Market Overview**

Wall Street suffered a sharp sell-off on Friday as risk sentiment deteriorated across the board.  
The **S&P 500 (SPX)** tumbled **–2.7%**, the **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** plunged **–3.49%**, and the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** shed **–1.9%**.  
Tech stocks led the decline, with profit-taking hitting large-cap names that had recently driven the rally. The move reflected a combination of valuation concerns and investor rotation into safe-haven assets.

### **Macro & Bonds**

The **U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield** fell nearly **2%**, as traders piled into bonds amid the equity rout. This flight-to-safety move pushed yields lower, signaling expectations of slower growth ahead or a potential shift in Fed policy tone.  
Meanwhile, the **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)** slipped **–0.55%**, marking a reversal after weeks of strength — a sign that global investors favored non-dollar assets and commodities as hedges.

### **Commodities**

Commodities surged as investors sought refuge.  
**Gold** advanced solidly, reclaiming higher ground above **$4,050/oz**, while **silver** and other precious metals also posted gains.  
**Oil** stabilized slightly higher, supported by the softer dollar and safe-haven inflows, despite ongoing worries about global demand.

### **Market Sentiment**

Friday’s move reflected classic **risk-off behavior** — equities down, yields down, dollar weaker, and commodities higher.  
The rotation into safety hints that markets may be pricing in tighter financial conditions or an economic slowdown ahead.  
Volatility spiked intraday, suggesting institutional repositioning rather than retail panic.
