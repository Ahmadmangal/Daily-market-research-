- **10-year Treasury yield** inched up slightly amid high equity enthusiasm.

## Macro & Labor Signals
- BLS announced a drastic **annual NFP revision**: the U.S. economy added **911,000 fewer jobs** between April 2024 and March 2025 than first reported—one of the largest revisions on record.  
  ([Reuters analysis](https://www.reuters.com/business/view-us-payrolls-growth-through-march-revised-sharply-lower-2025-09-09/), [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/economy-created-911-000-fewer-jobs-in-2024-2025-than-originally-reported-more-ammo-for-fed-rate-cut-0562a068))
- This fuels **growing expectations of imminent Fed rate cuts**.

## Consumer Sentiment
- The **New York Fed survey** revealed worker confidence in their ability to find a new job plunged to its **lowest level since 2013**, dropping nearly 6 percentage points to 44.9%.  
  ([NY Fed worker confidence](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/us/snplus/business/2025/09/09/wall-street-ticks-up-to-more-records-september-9), [WSJ reporting](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/employment-survey-weakens-adding-to-signs-of-faltering-labor-market-5c6348f5))

## FX & Gold Reaction
- The **U.S. dollar** slid to a **7-week low**—a reaction to labor market weakness and elevated Fed easing bets.  
  ([Reuters – dollar slump](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dollar-falls-hits-7-week-low-jobs-gloom-heightens-fed-cut-chances-2025-09-09/))
- **Gold** rallied to fresh highs (~$3,657/oz), supported by safe-haven flows and falling yields.

## Cross-Asset Summary
- **Equities** charged ahead as rate-cut hopes trumped labor concerns.  
- **Dollar weakness** aided commodities and equity sectors sensitive to currency (e.g., tech, gold).  
- **Yields** remain under pressure as markets reprice tighter Fed timelines.

## Quick Takeaway
Markets are looking past the battered jobs figures and falling worker confidence—betting the Fed will respond with cuts. Equities, gold, and the rate-sensitive narrative are powering ahead, but underlying labor softness risks future volatility.
