## Tesla’s -5.11% Decline: Key Drivers

Tesla dropped sharply (-5.11%) even after reporting record Q3 deliveries of ~497,000 vehicles.  

**Main reasons:**
- **Tax credit effect**: Surge in deliveries tied to the expiring $7,500 EV credit in the U.S., raising doubts about sustainable demand.  
- **Profit-taking**: After Tesla’s strong rally, many investors booked profits.  
- **Analyst skepticism**: Concerns that future quarters won’t replicate these delivery numbers without incentives.
