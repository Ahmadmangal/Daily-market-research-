## Equity Markets  
- **S&P 500** slipped **-0.41%** as investors locked in quarterly gains amid end-of-month rebalancing.  
- **Nasdaq 100 (NDX)** fell **-0.56%**, pressured by weakness in mega-cap tech (profit taking in NVIDIA and Microsoft).  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** edged **-0.18%** lower, holding up better thanks to defensive components.  

September closes with modest losses for the major indices, snapping a three-month winning streak as traders reposition for Q4.

## Macro & Rates  
- **Treasury Yields**: The 10-year yield ticked up to **4.17%**, retracing part of last week’s post-Fed decline as investors reassessed the path of future cuts.  
- **Fed Outlook**: Futures continue to price a **~65% chance of another 25 bps cut in December**, though Fed speakers reiterated a “data-dependent” stance.  
- **Dollar (DXY)**: The U.S. dollar index strengthened **+0.2%**, reflecting modest safe-haven flows.

## Commodities  
- **Gold** dipped **-0.3%** to around **$1,925/oz** as higher yields weighed on non-interest-bearing assets.  
- **WTI Crude Oil** held near **$65/bbl**, stabilizing after last week’s sharp drop driven by rising U.S. inventories and concerns over slowing global demand.

## Microstructure Note  
End-of-quarter flows added intraday volatility, with **ETF rebalancing** and **quarter-end hedging** producing wider bid-ask spreads in late afternoon trading.  
Liquidity pockets were visible in S&P futures, particularly around key gamma levels (~4,950), where dealers adjusted delta exposure.
