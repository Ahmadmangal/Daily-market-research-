# Daily Market Research — September 23, 2025  
*Uploaded Sep 24 PKT — researcher: Muhammad Ahmad*

## Market Recap
- **S&P 500** fell **~0.6%**, giving back recent gains as investors reassessed Powell’s post-cut comments.  
- **Nasdaq Composite / NDX** dropped **~0.9%**, led lower by large-cap tech weakness after Powell warned valuations were “fairly highly valued.”  
- **Dow Jones** slipped **~0.2%**, with industrials and cyclicals under pressure amid the risk-off tone. 

## Macro drivers
- **Powell / Fed tone:** Powell struck a cautious tone about inflation risks and the path forward despite the recent 25bp cut; his remarks reduced conviction that the Fed will move quickly to cut further, prompting a short-term risk repricing.   
- **Bond demand / yields:** Safe-haven buying earlier pressured yields slightly, but with mixed intraday flows as markets digested Powell’s comments. 

## Commodities & FX
- **WTI crude (front)** traded around **$63.6/bbl** after U.S. inventory data showed draws and ongoing supply concerns; Brent around $67.8. Oil was supported but remained range-bound.  
- **Gold** eased modestly from record levels reached previously as the dollar and yields stabilized.   
- **Dollar (DXY)** firmed slightly on a risk-off tilt after the Fed comments.

## Microstructure / Flow Notes
- **Liquidity:** Post-Powell, the order book thinned in the first few minutes — larger prints moved indices more than usual (classic thin-book post-event behavior).  
- **Options/Skew:** Tech names saw a pick-up in put buying and higher skew, increasing downside gamma for dealers and amplifying intraday selling pressure. (Observation based on traded flows / options tape.)

## Cross-Asset Read-through
- **Risk repricing:** Powell’s cautious phrasing trimmed appetite for the higher-valuation, rate-sensitive growth cohort while supporting modest flows into perceived cyclicals/defensives.  
- **Watch list:** upcoming CPI/PCE print will be market-moving — a hotter print would likely push yields up and deepen the equity pullback.
