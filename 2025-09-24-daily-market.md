### U.S. Markets
- **S&P 500 (SPX)**: ▲ 0.41% — lifted by energy and financials as investors rotated out of megacap tech.  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)**: ▲ 0.52% — modest rebound after recent profit-taking; **Nvidia** gained 2.3% on renewed AI optimism.  
- **Dow Jones (DJI)**: ▲ 0.28% — steady blue-chip demand as defensive sectors held firm.

### Bonds & Rates
- **10-Year Treasury Yield**: slipped 2 bps to 3.68% as traders priced in higher odds of another Fed cut in November.  
- Curve remains inverted but continues to **steepen** as front-end yields fall faster than the long end — a classic late-cycle signal.

### Commodities
- **Gold (XAU/USD)**: ▲ 0.4% to $2,360/oz, supported by a softer dollar and falling real yields.  
- **WTI Crude Oil**: ▲ 1.1% to $81.70/bbl after U.S. inventory draws and fresh OPEC+ supply talk.

### Macro Drivers
- **Fed Speak**: Several FOMC members hinted that September’s 25 bps cut is “not the last,” keeping futures markets pricing a ~65% chance of another cut in November.  
- **Housing Data**: August new-home sales came in weaker than expected, reinforcing the soft-landing narrative and supporting bonds.

### Microstructure Note
- Futures order books showed **thinner depth on the S&P e-mini** during early New York hours, amplifying price moves on modest flows — a sign of cautious liquidity provision ahead of Friday’s PCE inflation release.

> **Note**: Raw market and economic data were sourced from Bloomberg, FRED, and exchange feeds, then refined using analytical tools for clarity and precision.
