### **Market Overview**

U.S. equities edged lower on Thursday as traders stayed cautious ahead of next week’s inflation data and ongoing Fed commentary.  
The **S&P 500 (SPX)** closed down **0.28%**, the **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** slipped **0.15%**, while the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** fell **0.52%**.  
Sector rotation continued, with defensives holding firm and cyclicals lagging slightly. The market tone remained steady, not bearish — just consolidating after recent highs.

### **Commodities**

Precious metals showed resilience amid quiet trading. **Gold** remained **flat** near **$4,040/oz**, consolidating near its record highs as safe-haven demand persists.  
**Silver** extended gains, rising **1.2%**, supported by improving industrial sentiment and strong technical momentum.  
Meanwhile, **WTI crude** stayed roughly **flat around $62 per barrel**, with traders balancing weak demand forecasts against OPEC’s disciplined production levels.

### **Macro & Sentiment**

The **U.S. dollar** was steady, and **Treasury yields** showed little movement, signaling markets are in a “wait-and-see” mode before major macro data.  
Investor positioning remains cautious but not defensive — profit-taking in equities contrasts with steady buying in metals, suggesting balanced sentiment rather than fear.
