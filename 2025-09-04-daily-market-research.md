## Cross-Asset Reads

- **Metals**: Safe-haven demand remains intact.  
- **Bonds/Yields**: Likely to drift lower as labor conditions soften—supportive of rate cuts.

## If / Then Outlook
- **If** Friday’s jobs data is weak → rate-cut expectations firm up, fueling further gains in equities and metals.  
- **If** data surprises on the upside → possible setback for markets; yields may rebound and risk assets could retreat.

## What to Watch
- **August NFP & unemployment** (Friday) — the real Fed catalyst.  
- **Fed commentary** in response to data—especially on policy direction.
