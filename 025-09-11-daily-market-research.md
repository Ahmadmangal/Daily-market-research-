# Daily Market Research — September 11, 2025  
*Uploaded Sep 12 PKT — researcher: Muhammad Ahmad*

## Market Recap
- **S&P 500** slipped ~0.3%, giving back earlier gains.  
- **Nasdaq Composite** down ~0.5%, pressured by higher-than-expected inflation.  
- **Dow Jones** edged up ~0.2%, supported by industrials and REITs.  
- **Gold** jumped ~2%; breached $3,700/oz as real yields fell and uncertainty spiked.  
- **10-Year Treasury yield** rose modestly, while **2-year yields** held lower.  
- **US Dollar** rebounded slightly, aided by rising yields and inflation surprise.  

## Macro & Policy Drivers
- Latest **CPI data** came in hotter than forecasts: inflation components (shelter, services) held firm.  
- Fed rate-cut expectations were partially tempered—markets now see **lower odds of large cuts** without further weakening data.  

## Cross-Asset Insights
- Equities: Growth/Tech de-rated after inflation surprise. Defensive sectors held up better.  
- Bonds: Long end sold off on inflation surprise; front end remained supported by rate-cut hopes.  
- Gold: Benefited from weakening real yields and geopolitical uncertainty.  
- FX: USD strength resumed, hurting risk commodities slightly.

## If / Then Outlook
- If upcoming **jobs data** and **PPI** remain weak → cut odds recover, gold & bonds regain strength.  
- If inflation surprise repeats → yields rise, equities retreat further, dollar strengthens.

## What to Watch Next
- **PPI (Producer Price Index)** release.  
- **Retail Sales** and **consumer sentiment** data.  
- Fed speeches for clues on tapering rate-cut pace.
