# Street Calls of the Week — Week Ending Aug 31, 2025

## Equity Analyst Highlights
- **Sunrun (RUN)**: **RBC Capital upgraded to Outperform**, citing strong free cash flow and dominance in U.S. solar leasing. Analysts see further upside into 2026.  
- **Nvidia (NVDA)**: Analysts reiterated **Buy**, noting strong AI-related demand after unveiling new data-center GPU partnerships. Stock rose 1.09% last week.  
- **Tesla (TSLA)**: Street remains divided; some analysts warn of margin compression from EV price wars, while others emphasize growth in energy storage.  

## Macro & Policy Drivers
- **Federal Reserve**: Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks still dominate; odds of a **25 bps rate cut in September** remain high (~90%). Focus shifts to next week’s **PCE inflation data** and **jobs report**.  
- **Geopolitics & Trade**: U.S.–China tariff tensions remain a headwind; no major resolution yet, but street expects volatility around September trade talks.  
- **Europe/UK**: ECB officials signaled resilience against U.S. tariffs. BoE prepares for its **September 7 meeting**, with inflation stickiness still the key risk.  

## Cross-Asset Reads
- **Equities**: S&P 500 closed higher on the week (+0.4%), Nasdaq gained +0.5%, and Dow +0.3%, led by AI/tech momentum.  
- **Bonds**: U.S. 10Y yields fell ~7 bps, reflecting dovish Fed bets. Market pricing implies easing financial conditions ahead.  
- **Commodities**:  
  - **Gold** posted its strongest month in four, reinforcing safe-haven demand.  
  - **Oil** gained +1.3% on supply concerns, despite slowing demand signals.  

## My Take
Markets ended August on a cautiously optimistic note—AI and solar names lead equities, while bonds rally on dovish Fed bets; upcoming PCE/jobs data could reset the tone for September.
