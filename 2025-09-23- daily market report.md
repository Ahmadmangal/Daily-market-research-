###  Market Recap (Sept 23, 2025)
U.S. equities closed slightly higher on Monday as investors balanced last week’s Fed rate cut with upcoming economic data.  
- **S&P 500 (SPX)**: ▲ **0.28%** – Extended modest gains as energy and financials outperformed.  
- **Nasdaq 100 (NDX)**: ▲ **0.45%** – Tech led by AI-chip names; Nvidia and Microsoft supported upside despite mild profit-taking in mega-cap growth.  
- **Dow Jones (DJIA)**: ▲ **0.19%** – Industrials and healthcare helped offset weakness in consumer staples.  

###  Macro & Fed
- **Fed Rate Path**: Markets remain confident that at least one more **25 bps cut** is possible this year, with Fed officials entering a quiet period before key inflation data.  
- **Treasuries**: **10Y yield** hovered near **3.98%**, reflecting stable demand after last week’s post-cut rally.  
- **Dollar**: DXY steadied as traders weighed global rate differentials.

###  Commodities
- **Gold (GC)**: ▲ **0.4%** to around $2,490/oz, supported by softer real yields and ongoing rate-cut expectations.  
- **WTI Crude (CL)**: ▲ **0.7%** to ~$84/bbl on signs of tighter global supply.

###  Microstructure View
Order books across major indices showed **narrower bid-ask spreads** than last week, indicating improving liquidity as volatility cooled post-FOMC. Futures volume in S&P 500 **ES contracts** remained elevated but with lower implied volatility, suggesting short-term positioning rather than panic hedging.
