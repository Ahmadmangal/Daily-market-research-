## Key Drivers
- **Corporate earnings**: Dell plunged ~9% due to rising production costs and weak AI margin guidance; Nvidia declined ~3.3% amid overhang from China and valuation concerns. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/snapshot-wall-street-opens-lower-after-inflation-data-tariff-concerns-weigh-2025-08-29/))  
- **Tariff policy**: The U.S. officially ended the “de minimis” exemption—small parcels (<$800) now face duties—raising costs for global e-commerce. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/what-end-de-minimis-exemption-means-us-shoppers-businesses-2025-08-29/))  
- **Trade tensions**: A court ruled most Trump-era tariffs were illegal—those tariffs remain in place until Oct 14 but the decision adds legal uncertainty to trade policy direction.

- **India update**: Despite U.S. tariffs, India’s Q2 GDP rose ~7.8%, showing firm economic resilience. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-economy-unexpectedly-picks-up-steam-despite-trumps-tariff-threats-2025-08-29/))

## Cross-Asset Read-Through
- **Equities**: Macro and tech fragility dragging risk appetite; markets nervous ahead of U.S. PCE data.  
- **FX / Commodities**: Gold benefiting from risk-off; energy under pressure from weaker demand.  
- **Global markets**: Asia held modest gains, propped up by AI optimism (despite regional divergences in China/Japan). ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-1-2025-08-29/))

## Microstructure Note
- **Tech sell-off** triggered tighter bid-ask spreads and elevated options skew in major names like NVDA and DELL.

## If / Then
- **If** this week’s PCE/jobs data are soft → cut odds strengthen, yields fall, and equities likely bounce.  
- **If** data surprise hot → expect a yield spike, a tech-led correction, and risk-off broadening.

## What to Watch
- **July PCE inflation** (US) — today. Fed’s preferred gauge and key for rate expectations.  
- **US jobs data** — out Friday. A key labor signal heading into September. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-week-ahead-us-jobs-data-poses-test-rate-cut-hopes-stocks-rally-2025-08-29/))  
- **BoE & UK data** — banks fell over tax fears; upcoming UK inflation figures will be instructive. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-1-2025-08-29/))

## Quick Takeaway
Risk appetite turned fragile for now. Markets are shifting focus toward real-time data (PCE, jobs) and policy clarity—especially around tariffs and Fed independence.
