## Market Overview

U.S. equities started the week on a mixed tone as investors weighed fresh macro signals and awaited upcoming Fed commentary.  
The **S&P 500 (SPX)** rose **+0.36%**, while the **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** gained **+0.78%**, led by strength in mega-cap tech and semiconductor names.  
The **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)**, however, slipped **–0.14%**, dragged by weakness in industrial and energy components.  

Market sentiment stayed cautious as traders continued to debate whether the recent rally has priced in too many rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.  
Risk appetite leaned toward growth names, with tech once again outperforming defensive sectors.

## Macroeconomic and Policy Developments

There were no major data releases on Monday, but focus remained on upcoming **FOMC minutes** (scheduled for October 9).

Comments from Fed officials hinted at a balancing act — easing policy to support slowing growth while maintaining vigilance against lingering inflation pressures.  

Investors continued monitoring Washington’s partial government shutdown standoff, though near-term market reaction has been muted.
