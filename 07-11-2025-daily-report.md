**U.S. equities** declined sharply on Thursday as renewed profit-taking and rising yields pressured risk assets.  
The **S&P 500 (SPX)** fell **1.2%**, the **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** dropped **1.91%**, and the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** slipped **0.84%**. Tech and growth names led the downside as traders reassessed the path of rate cuts and positioned cautiously ahead of next week’s economic data releases.

In **precious metals**, **gold** regained momentum, rising **0.5%** to reclaim the **$4,000/oz** level amid renewed safe-haven demand. **Silver** outperformed, surging **1.2%** as investors rotated toward hard assets amid equity weakness.

Overall, the session reflected **risk-off sentiment** — equities sold off broadly while precious metals benefited from renewed volatility and defensive flows.
