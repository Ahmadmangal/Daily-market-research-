**U.S. equities** advanced on Wednesday, continuing their upward momentum as investors balanced optimism around cooling inflation with caution ahead of upcoming Fed communication.  
The **S&P 500 (SPX)** rose **0.37%**, the **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** gained **0.72%**, and the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** climbed **0.48%**. Tech stocks once again led the move higher, helped by moderate yields and stable macro expectations.

In **commodities**, **gold** consolidated near the **$4,000/oz** mark after a volatile stretch, signaling indecision among traders as markets await fresh catalysts. **Silver** traded around **$48**, holding steady after recent gains.

Overall sentiment remains **cautiously bullish** — equities are extending their recovery phase while precious metals are pausing after a strong run.  
Investors now turn attention to next week’s economic data and any new hints from the **Federal Reserve** regarding future policy direction.
