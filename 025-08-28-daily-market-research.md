# Daily Market Research — August 28, 2025  
*Uploaded on Aug 29 PKT*

## Market Recap
- **S&P 500** notched a **record high close**, up ~0.32%.  
- **Nasdaq** gained ~0.53%, driven by tech/AI momentum.  
- **Dow Jones** climbed with a modest gain. 0  
- **US 10Y yield** dropped to roughly **4.21%**, down ~2–3 bps intraday. 1  
- **Nvidia** dipped ~0.8% despite a 56% revenue jump; China trade concerns weighed. 2  
- **Sensex/Nifty** fell ~0.8% on announcement of 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. 3

## Key Drivers
- **AI earnings + GDP revision** kept momentum alive (especially note on Nvidia and AI optimism). 4  
- **Fed outlook** remains dovish: Jackson Hole tone continues to anchor rate cut expectations.  
- **Tariff shock** triggered sell-off in India’s export-linked sectors. 5

## Cross-Asset Read-Through
- **Equities supported** by easing rate sentiment (AI-heavy indexes rally).  
- **Yields lower** front-end; long-end reactive to inflation/term-premium.  
- **FX & Commodities**: Dollar softened; gold bid; oil pulled back.  
- **India**: Rupee briefly recovered, then weakened amid heavy importer hedging. 6

## Microstructure Note
- **NVDA options skew** widened post-guidance, reflecting elevated volatility pricing.

## If / Then
- **If** Friday’s PCE or jobs data come in **soft**, front-end yields likely drop further and equities may rally.  
- **If** data surprises **hot**, yields could spike and equities may cool off.

## What to Watch
- **US PCE (Aug 29 release)** — key Fed indicator.  
- **UK CPI / BoE (Sep 18)** — next policy event.  
- **India**: Tariff impact, export earnings, RBI commentary.

## Takeaway
AI remains the structural bull driver, and markets are pricing in easing—but geopolitical shocks and data will define the next leg.
