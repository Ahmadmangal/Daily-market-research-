### Market Recap
U.S. equities fell for a **second straight session** on Thursday as rising Treasury yields  
and a firmer U.S. dollar pressured risk assets.  
- **S&P 500**: ↓ **0.61%** – Broad-based declines led by technology and consumer discretionary.  
- **Nasdaq 100 (NDX)**: ↓ **0.95%** – Mega-cap tech sold off as higher yields dampened growth valuations.  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)**: ↓ **0.33%** – Defensive healthcare stocks limited losses.

### Key Macro Drivers
- **Treasury Yields**: The **10-year yield** climbed to **4.01%**, reflecting expectations of  
  sticky inflation and a slower Fed cutting path.  
- **Dollar Index (DXY)**: ↑ **0.3%**, extending its post-Fed rally as investors sought safety.  
- **Economic Data**: Weekly U.S. jobless claims edged down to **208k** vs. 215k forecast,  
  signaling continued labor market resilience.

### Commodities
- **Gold**: Slipped **0.2%** to **$1,937/oz** as a stronger dollar offset Fed-cut expectations.  
- **WTI Crude**: ↓ **1.1%** to **$62.40/bbl**, pressured by concerns over weaker global demand  
  and rising U.S. inventories (EIA data).

### Microstructure View
Market depth in **S&P 500 futures (ES)** remained thin around the 4,880–4,900 zone,  
allowing intraday algo strategies to push prices lower with relatively small order sizes.  
Implied vol in front-month SPX options ticked higher as traders added downside hedges.
