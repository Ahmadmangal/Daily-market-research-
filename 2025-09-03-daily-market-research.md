## Market Recap

  ([AP News](https://www.apnews.com/article/814d5a53be8b6991b371887c3bffd450))  
- **Alphabet (GOOGL)** jumped **~6–9%** after court ruled against breaking up Google, allowing it to keep Chrome & Android and continue Apple search payments.

## Macro & Policy Drivers
- **Antitrust ruling**: Judge Mehta avoided a structural breakup, opting instead for limited remedies (data sharing and ban on exclusivity). Markets cheered; critics called it “a slap on the wrist.”

- **Jobs data**: Softer-than-expected job openings signaled weakening labor market, reinforcing Fed cut expectations ahead of Friday’s report.

## Cross-Asset Read-Through
- **Equities**: Big tech led the bounce, particularly GOOGL/AAPL after legal relief.  
- **Bonds & Yields**: A risk-off tone and weaker job data eased front-end yields; long-end yields rose due to fiscal caution.  
- **Gold/ Commodities**: Gold extended upside with risk protection flows.

## Microstructure Note
- **Mega-cap rally** came with heavy tech flows, while breadth remained narrow; gold traded with lighter liquidity due to post-holiday thinness.

## If / Then Outlook
- **If** Friday’s jobs data beats expectations → markets may re-price, yields could rise and equities may lose momentum.  
- **If** data is weak → stronger cut expectations likely, supporting equities & gold, and pushing yields lower.

## What to Watch
- **U.S. Jobs Report** (Friday) — key to Fed outlook.  
- **Treasury issuance** this week — will influence yield angles.  
- **EU antitrust response / AI regulation** — potential follow-up to U.S. ruling.
