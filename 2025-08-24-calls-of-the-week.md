# Key Market Calls of the Week — Aug 24, 2025

## Macro & Policy
- **Fed**: Powell signaled the door is open to a **September rate cut** but stressed data-dependence; markets lifted cut odds and risk assets rallied.  
- **ECB**: After a likely **September pause**, officials may revisit **additional cuts later in 2025** if growth/inflation weaken; watch Oct/Dec meetings.  
- **US Inflation Focus**: This week’s **PCE** (the Fed’s preferred gauge) is pivotal—an upside surprise could temper cut odds despite Powell’s dovish tilt.  

## Equity Analyst Highlights
- **Sunrun (RUN)** — Upgrade & bullish commentary lifted the name; solar sentiment improving.  
- **Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)** — Positive analyst takeaways; AI/edge themes in focus.  
- **Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)**, **Avis (CAR)**, **Ondas (ONDS)**, **Roblox (RBLX)** — Mixed analyst actions across media, travel, wireless, and gaming.  

## Cross-Asset View
- **Rates**: Front-end yields most sensitive to near-term cut odds; curve reaction hinges on growth data.  
- **Equities**: Dovish shift supports indices, but several investors warn **cuts alone won’t sustain** a rally if labor/inflation data disappoints.  
- **Europe**: ECB “pause then reassess” keeps euro-rates path data-dependent; tariff backdrop a watch item for Germany.  

## Reflection
Powell nudged policy toward easing, but **PCE + labor** must confirm—otherwise this relief bid can fade.
