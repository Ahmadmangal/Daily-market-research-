## Market Overview (Oct 17, 2025)
- **S&P 500 (SPX)**: **+0.53%**  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)**: **+0.65%**  
- **Dow Jones (DJI)**: **+0.52%**  

Equities rallied broadly as buyers returned after recent weakness; tech participation helped Nasdaq outperform slightly.

---

## Fixed Income & Dollar
- **US 10-Year yield**: **+0.91%** (yields up — bond prices down)  
- **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)**: **+0.20%**

A move higher in yields and a firmer dollar signaled a re-risking into duration-sensitive positions and pushed some capital away from non-USD havens.

---

## Commodities / Precious Metals
- **Gold**: **−1.75%** (sharp decline)  
- **Silver**: **−4.24%** (sharp decline)  
- **Oil / other commodities**: mixed / modest moves

Gold and silver sold off heavily as rising real yields and a stronger dollar increased the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding metals and triggered stop/liquidation flows in leveraged metal products.

---

## Microstructure / Flow Notes
- Equity buy flows were concentrated in large-caps and tech ETFs; bid depth improved after thin mid-day liquidity.  
- Metals saw outsized intraday selling, consistent with levered ETF unwind and options-hedge rebalancing on the yield move.

## Quick Take
Yesterday’s session looks like a **risk-on equity rally funded by a repricing in rates** — higher yields and stronger dollar undermined precious-metal bids. Watch whether yields stabilize; if they continue higher, expect more pressure on duration-sensitive assets and metals.
