### Market Overview
U.S. equities ended the session higher as investors continued to digest the Fed’s recent 25 bps rate cut and its guidance on future easing.  
- **S&P 500**: **+0.59%** – steady buying into the close, led by cyclical sectors.  
- **Nasdaq 100 (QQQ)**: **+0.41%** – tech gained modestly as traders rotated toward quality mega-cap names.  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)**: **+0.65%** – industrials and financials outperformed on strong breadth.

### Macro Highlights
- **U.S. Dollar**: The **DXY slipped** as traders priced in a softer Fed path, boosting demand for non-dollar assets.  
- **Gold**: **Rose to fresh monthly highs**, benefiting from lower real yields and renewed safe-haven flows.  
- **Bonds**: Treasury yields eased slightly as markets reinforced expectations of another potential Fed cut before year-end.

### Microstructure Notes
Order flow showed **passive bid dominance** across major equity ETFs (SPY, QQQ), with notable iceberg buy orders absorbing morning dips. Futures volumes on ES (S&P minis) were above the 20-day average, suggesting institutional accumulation into strength.
