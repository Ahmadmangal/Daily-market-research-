# Daily Market Research — September 10, 2025  
*Uploaded Sep 11 PKT — researcher: Muhammad Ahmad*

## Market Recap
- **S&P 500** rose ~0.48%, **Nasdaq** +0.33% after cooler-than-expected wholesale inflation data pushed rate-cut hopes. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/sp-500-nasdaq-hit-record-highs-after-inflation-data-boosts-rate-cut-bets-oracle-2025-09-10/))  
- **Oracle** surged ~35%, boosted by massive AI cloud infrastructure demand and lofty future revenue guidance.  
- **Nvidia** gained around **3.8%**, lifted by the tech/AI rally and strong data-center/cloud sector momentum. ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/oracle-vs-nvidia-vs-tsmc-stocks-soar-share-prices-rise-which-one-is-current-poster-child-of-ai-boom-in-u-s-stock-market/articleshow/123812903.cms?from=mdr))  
- **Apple** dropped ~3%, weighed down by what analysts considered a lukewarm reaction to its iPhone 17 launch and concerns about upgrade cycles. ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-09-10-2025?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhFYxqcxDFdquzDqczgH4vhT3l2Y-fzBhesuKBLnAjJl4womzGraUA9&gaa_sig=zL_wd-QROnKOVqJFtakZCK-_XaAct5iQHTMuBw8Uzy0P4UlovNSkSGykCg5e5WqEc5BEXgqko06mBJMtLSkQ%3D%3D&gaa_ts=68c265df))  
- **10-Year Treasury yields** fell slightly as market priced in higher chance of rate cuts; gold pushed higher nearing record levels. ([Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-sp-500-nasdaq-inflation-data-oracle-orcl-stock/))

## Macro & Policy Drivers
- The August **Producer Price Index (PPI)** came in cooler than expected (declined ~0.1%), reviving expectations that inflation pressures are easing. This strengthens the case for the Fed to deliver rate cuts. ([Schwab Market Update](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/stock-market-update-open))  
- Rate cut probabilities are now highly priced: market sees ~90% odds for a **25 bps cut** next Fed meeting. Some are even considering a **50 bps cut** in a dovish tail scenario. ([Reuters wrap](https://www.reuters.com/business/sp-500-nasdaq-hit-record-highs-after-inflation-data-boosts-rate-cut-bets-oracle-2025-09-10/))

## Cross-Asset Insights
- **Equities:** Tech & AI names are leading; defensive / consumer discretionary lagging. Oracle’s strength lit up the cloud & chip “syns” like Nvidia.  
- **Bonds & Yields:** Yields drift lower, especially on the front end, as inflation cools and rate cuts look nearer.  
- **Gold:** Appreciating as real yields fall and inflation fears subside.  
- **USD:** Slightly weaker, pressured by dovish inflation data and increasing cut bets.

## If / Then Outlook
- **If** CPI and core CPI surprise to the downside → rate-cut odds will increase further, sending equities and gold higher, yields lower.  
- **If** inflation surprises upside → yields could pop, tech could correct, markets may rotate toward value or defensive sectors.

## What to Watch Next
- Thursday’s **CPI & core CPI** report (August) — likely big reaction.  
- Fed Chair speeches / minutes as the meeting approaches.  
- Earnings from major techs, especially ones with AI exposure.  
- Consumer sentiment & inflation expectations (survey data).
