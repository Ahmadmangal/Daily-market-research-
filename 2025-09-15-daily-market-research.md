# Daily Market Research — September 15, 2025  
*Uploaded Sep 16 PKT — researcher: Muhammad Ahmad*

## Market Recap  
- S&P 500 closed +0.5% at a record high of **6,615.28**, led by a tech-sector rally. Nasdaq rose ~0.9%, Dow edged up 0.1%.   
- Alphabet surged ~4.5%, pushing its market cap above $3 trillion. Tesla jumped ~3.6% after Elon Musk made a ~$1B stock purchase.   

## Gold & Commodities  
- Gold hit an all-time high (~$3,685.39) as the dollar weakened and Treasury yields eased.  
- Silver and other precious metals remained mixed; oil prices rose modestly amid supply concerns and demand optimism.   

## Macro & Policy Sentiment  
- Markets are pricing in a nearly certain **25 basis-points rate cut** by the Fed this week, with expectations for further cuts later in 2025.   
- Inflation remains sticky in core areas, though wholesale price metrics showed some easing. Labor market data continues to reflect cooling dynamics.   

## Currencies & Yields  
- The U.S. dollar fell to a ~2.5-month low vs the euro, driven by rate cut anticipation.  
- Yields on U.S. Treasuries declined slightly, especially at the long end, reflecting heightened demand for bonds and reduced yield expectations.   

## Key Stock Movers  
- Seagate soared ~7.7% to a record high on strong demand for AI data infrastructure. Western Digital also climbed on similar tailwinds.   

## If / Then Outlook  
- **If** Fed delivers a dovish cut + good forward guidance → equities and gold likely extend gains; yields fall further.  
- **If** inflation surprises to upside or Fed signals only one cut → possible pullback in tech; safe-haven assets (gold, Treasuries) catch upside.

## What to Watch Next  
- Fed meeting & Powell’s statement, especially projections and dot plot.  
- Core PCE inflation & services inflation data.  
- U.S.-China trade developments & regulatory actions vs key tech firms.
