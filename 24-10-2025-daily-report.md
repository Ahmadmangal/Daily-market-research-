## Market Overview

U.S. markets traded mixed on Friday as tech strength lifted the broader indexes, while industrials lagged behind.

- **S&P 500 (SPX)** rose **+0.79%**, extending its recent recovery.  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** advanced **+1.00%**, supported by gains in large-cap tech and AI-related names.  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** slipped **–1.00%**, dragged down by weakness in energy and industrial sectors.

The divergence between the Dow and Nasdaq reflected a sectoral rotation — investors moved capital from cyclical and industrial stocks back into growth-heavy tech plays.

## Commodities

Precious metals eased slightly:  
- **Gold** fell **–0.35%**, consolidating after recent highs.  
- **Silver** declined **–0.45%**, following broader softness in commodity markets.

The pullback in metals came as investors favored risk assets, while real yields inched higher, capping demand for non-yielding assets.

## Macro View

Investor sentiment improved modestly thanks to resilient earnings from major tech firms, but the broader market remained cautious ahead of next week’s inflation data and Fed commentary.

The dollar traded steady, and volatility stayed contained, signaling a balanced risk environment.
