## Market Overview

U.S. equities started the week on a strong note as investors regained confidence following last week’s volatility. All three major indices advanced solidly on Monday, led by tech and cyclical names.

- **S&P 500 (SPX)** gained **+1.00%**  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** rose **+1.30%**  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** climbed **+1.12%**

Risk appetite returned amid hopes of stabilizing inflation and easing Treasury yields, helping equities bounce broadly across sectors.

## Commodities

Precious metals pulled back as capital rotated into risk assets.  
- **Gold** fell **–0.69%**, slipping below the $4,000/oz mark.  
- **Silver** also declined **–0.86%**, reflecting reduced haven demand.  

Energy and base metals traded relatively mixed, with oil steady after recent swings.

## Macro View

The market tone turned risk-on as investors shifted focus from last week’s correction to upcoming corporate earnings. Bond yields remained relatively stable, and the U.S. dollar showed little net change, providing a calm backdrop for equities.  

Traders continue to monitor upcoming Fed communications and economic data for further direction on rate-cut expectations.
