*Uploaded Sep 6 (PKT)*

## Market Recap
- **S&P 500** −0.3% to **6,481.5**; **Nasdaq** ~flat; **Dow** −0.5%. Small caps outperformed (**R2000** +0.5%). Stocks briefly hit fresh records intraday before fading on growth worries. (AP recap) 0  
- **U.S. yields** fell on weak labor data: **2Y −~6 bps**, **10Y −~8 bps** into the close. (Reuters)   
- **Gold** surged to a **new record near $3,600/oz** as rate-cut bets firmed. (Reuters)

## Macro & Policy (Jobs-led)
- **August NFP:** **+22k** (vs ~+75k consensus); **unemployment 4.3%** (4-yr high). Revisions showed earlier summer weakness. Markets increased odds of a **Fed cut in September** (some chatter of **50 bps**). (Reuters, Investopedia)
  

## Cross-Asset Read-Through
- **Equities:** Early “cuts = bullish” impulse faded into the close as weak growth narrative dominated. Mega-caps mixed; breadth better in small caps. (AP/Reuters)   
- **Rates/Dollar:** Front-end yields dropped on cut pricing; softer dollar aided metals. (Reuters)   
- **Gold:** Record high underscores demand for duration/safe-haven amid softer macro. (Reuters) 

## Ongoing Single-Name/Theme to Watch
- **Alphabet & Apple:** After **Sept 3** antitrust ruling spared a breakup, **GOOGL** rallied sharply and **AAPL** benefited from continued default-search economics—sentiment tailwind into this week even as macro drove Friday. (Reuters) 

## If / Then
- **If** incoming data (claims, ISM services prices) stays soft → **cut odds up**, **yields down**, **gold supported**, equities biased higher but sensitive to growth.  
- **If** data re-accelerates → **yields rebound**, **gold cools**, equities could rotate defensively.

## What to Watch Next
- **Fedspeak** post-jobs (guidance on Sept meeting).  
- **Treasury auctions** & term premium chatter (curve reaction).  
- **Next week’s CPI preview window** & any wage/claims signals.
