### **Equities**
U.S. equities extended their upward momentum on Wednesday as risk sentiment improved following recent dovish Fed commentary and resilient tech earnings.  
- **S&P 500 (SPX)** rose **+0.58%**, reclaiming early-week losses and edging closer to its all-time high.  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)** jumped **+1.19%**, driven by gains in major tech names, particularly semiconductors and AI-related stocks.  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)** was **flat**, showing little movement as industrial and energy components balanced out.  

Traders continue to position for a soft landing scenario where inflation cools without a deep economic contraction.

### **Commodities**
Commodity markets traded mixed:  
- **WTI Crude Oil** gained **+0.48%**, rebounding slightly as U.S. inventory data showed moderate drawdowns. Supply expectations remain tight but global demand uncertainty capped upside.  
- **Gold** held **flat near $4,040/oz**, consolidating after its recent breakout past the $4,000 psychological level. Investors paused amid stable yields and dollar firmness.  
- **Silver** advanced **+0.79%**, tracking broader gains in industrial metals as manufacturing optimism improved.

### **Macro & Cross-Asset View**
The **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)** edged **+0.2% higher**, reflecting continued strength in U.S. real yields despite mounting rate-cut expectations.  
Bond yields were steady, suggesting markets are awaiting fresh data from next week’s CPI print and FOMC minutes for policy clues.  
Overall, the session reflected a “risk-on but selective” tone — tech led, defensive sectors lagged, and commodities stabilized.
