### Market Recap
U.S. equities retreated on Tuesday as investors digested last week’s **25 bps Fed rate cut** and a firm message of *data dependence* from Chair Powell.  
- **S&P 500**: ↓ **0.42%** – Tech-heavy names under pressure.  
- **Nasdaq 100 (NDX)**: ↓ **0.75%** – Semiconductors and cloud stocks led declines.  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)**: ↓ **0.18%** – Defensive sectors limited losses.  

Treasury yields were mixed: the **10-year yield** hovered near **3.92%**, little changed as traders weighed the Fed’s next move.  
The **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)** gained **0.2%**, reflecting safe-haven flows and reinforcing headwinds for commodities.

### Key Macro Drivers
- **Fed Policy**: After cutting 25 bps last week, futures markets still price in a **60% chance of another cut in December** (CME FedWatch).  
- **Economic Data**: September consumer confidence slipped to **102.5** vs. 104 prior (Conference Board), signaling softer household sentiment.
- **Global**: Eurozone PMIs showed contraction, keeping the ECB cautious.

### Commodities
- **Gold**: Flat around **$1,942/oz**, as a stronger dollar offset lower yields.  
- **WTI Crude**: Steady near **$63/bbl**, holding the lower end of its recent range amid concerns over global demand.

### Microstructure View
Order-book depth in S&P futures remained thin during the U.S. afternoon session,  
with **liquidity pockets** around the 4,950 level attracting short-term algos.  
Implied volatility in near-dated SPX options ticked higher, indicating increased hedging demand.
