## Cross-Asset View

The session reflected a mild **risk-off tone** — equities softened, the dollar strengthened, and gold spiked to record levels.

Bond yields edged higher, suggesting positioning adjustments rather than panic.  

Markets now look toward **FOMC minutes** and **upcoming CPI data** for clearer direction.
