## Market Overview  
U.S. equities rebounded on Monday, buoyed by signs of progress in U.S.–China trade talks and easing inflation concerns.  
- **S&P 500 (SPX)**: **+1.23%**  
- **Nasdaq-100 (NDX)**: **+1.83%**  
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)**: **+0.71%**  

The rally was led by tech and growth stocks, as investors re-entered risk assets after recent turbulence.

## Commodities & Metals  
Precious metals extended their recent correction amid stronger risk appetite and higher bond yields.  
- **Gold**: **−0.65%**  
- **Silver**: **−0.58%**  

Gold’s drop follows a steep recent decline (~6.3% in past days), as safe-haven flows reversed and yields rose.

## Currencies & Macro Drivers  
- **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)**: **+0.18%**  

**Key news driver**: Optimism around U.S.–China relations and an expected policy meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week spurred risk sentiment.  
1  

Markets appear to be pricing in more favourable trade terms and the possibility of easier monetary policy, which helped equities rebound and pressured non-yielding assets like gold.

### Quick Take  
A classic risk-on day: stocks up, metals down, dollar up. The backdrop is improving trade odds and a potential shift in Fed tone. Watch whether metals find support or continue to correct as yields climb, and whether the tech rally sustains into the earnings-heavy week ahead.
