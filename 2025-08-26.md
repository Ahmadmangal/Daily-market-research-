## Market Drivers

###  Trade Tensions & Fed Outlook
- Markets remain on edge over recent political pressure on the Fed and discussion around its independence — creating uncertainty in rate policy. 
- Meanwhile, dovish signals from Powell at Jackson Hole continue to reinforce expectations of a September rate cut. 2

### Bonds & Yields
- The dip in the 10Y yield reflects cautious bond positioning: investors are weighing growth concerns against inflation, leaning toward easier policy.


##  If / Then Scenarios
- **If** upcoming PCE or jobs data disappoints → we may see further yield compression and equity re-rally.
- **If** data surprises to the upside → bond yields could spike and risk sentiment may cool rapidly.


## Reflection
Markets remain buoyant—but with Powell’s comments behind us, the next real catalyst lies in data prints.
